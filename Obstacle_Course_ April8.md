# In this assignment, we programed the Robot to go through the obstacle course me and Scarlett designed and built. 

drivetrain.turn_for(LEFT,5, DEGREES)
drivetrain.drive_for(FORWARD, 300, MM)
drivetrain.turn_for(RIGHT, 15, DEGREES)
drivetrain.drive_for(FORWARD, 400, MM)
drivetrain.turn_for(LEFT, 25, DEGREES)
drivetrain.drive_for(FORWARD, 300, MM)
# The codes above are for navigating through the red balls at the start
drivetrain.turn_for(LEFT, 70, DEGREES)
drivetrain.drive_for(FORWARD, 100, MM)
drivetrain.turn_for(LEFT, 110, DEGREES)
#The following ones above are for passing through the wall and going through the wall.
drivetrain.drive_for(FORWARD, 1100, MM)
#The line above is for move a blue ball into a goal, I don't know how to highlight it though.
drivetrain.drive_for(REVERSE, 1100, MM)
drivetrain.turn_for(RIGHT, 90, DEGREES)
# Reversing through the goal and turning towards the seesaw.
drivetrain.drive_for(FORWARD, 500, MM)
drivetrain.turn_for(LEFT, 90, DEGREES)
drivetrain.drive_for(FORWARD, 1100, MM)
# going up the seesaw and to the finish line.



# Steps for the obstacle course:
# Step 1: Go through the 3 red balls and end up beside the wall
# Step 2: Go around the wall, make sure not to hit it.
# Step 3: Go through the tunnel and straight to the red ball.
# Step 4: Push the Red ball into the goal and move reverse and turn right.
# Step 5: Go over the seesaw and reach the end.


#Reflection - Me and Scarlett did well on this project, during this time, we built the obstacles and started to code, but today the code was having some troubles, but we worked through them during class and fixed it. We needed to lock in today, and we did. So at the end, we both worked well around the problems and fixed them.
